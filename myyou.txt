Jungkook song-My you
Summer has already spread in the air
Summer has already spread in the air
Breeze is already blowing
Breeze is already blowing
The last cold snap is going out
The last cold snap is going out
The days were getting longer and longer
The days were getting longer and longer
But my days were still going on and on and on
But my days were still going on and on and on
I got wet in the Sun shower and looked up at the night sky
I got wet in the Sun shower and looked up at the night sky

It was quite a lonely night
It was quite a lonely night
In the blink of an eye
In the blink of an eye
The dark faded out
The dark faded out
Blooming under the sunlight
Blooming under the sunlight
Memories with me and you

All these lights are colored in by you
All these lights are colored in by you
All these times are precious due to you
All these times are precious due to you
Four seasons have passed with you
Four seasons have passed with you
Four scents were left ‘cause of you
Four scents were left ‘cause of you

All the reasons why I can laugh out
All the reasons why I can laugh out
All the reasons why I sing this song
All the reasons why I sing this song
Thankful to be by your side now
Thankful to be by your side now
I'll try to shine brighter than now
I'll try to shine brighter than now

네 번의 계절 또다시

더 짙어지게 또다시

내가 미소를 짓는 이유도
naega misoreul jinneun iyudo
이 노랠 부를 수 있는 것도

네 곁이기에 감사해

On a starry night
On a starry night
Hope my you sleep tight
Hope my you sleep tight
Shining purple light
Shining purple light
Thankful to be by your side now
Thankful to be by your side now

On a starry night
On a starry night
Hope my you sleep tight
Hope my you sleep tight
Shining purple light
Shining purple light
네 곁이기에 감사해
