\multicolumn{5}{l}{\footnotesize Notes:LPM regressions. We report wild bootstrap cluster p-values in parentheses and wild bootstrap cluster 95                percent confidence intervals in square brackets, generated using boottest command in Stata 14 (Roodman et al.                2019) for standard errors clustered at the class level (12 clusters). In columns 1 and 2, the dependent variable is a                dummy equal to one if the student took Intermediate Micro the year after the Principles class. In columns 3 and 4,                the dependent variable is a dummy equal to one if the student enrolled in another economics class at any time after                the Principles class (up to January 2019).}\vspace{-.25em} \\
