\multicolumn{5}{l}{\footnotesize Notes: LPM regressions. Standard errors are clustered at the class level (12 clusters). In columns 1 and 2, the dependent variable is a dummy equal to one if the student took Intermediate Micro the year after the Principles class. In columns 3 and 4, the dependent variable is a dummy equal to one if the student enrolled in another economics class at any time after the Principles class (up to January 2019).}\vspace{-.25em} \\
